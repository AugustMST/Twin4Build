# BuildingEnergyModel

This project provides a flexible framework for dynamic modelling of energy consumption in buildings. 
It is based on the ontologies [SAREF4BLDG](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/) and [SAREF4BLDG](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/). 
This is currently a python-only project.
