# Twin4Build Building Energy Model

This project provides a flexible framework for dynamic modelling of energy consumption in buildings. 
It is based on the ontologies [SAREF4BLDG](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/) and [SAREF4SYST](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/). 
This is currently a python-only project.

The package has been tested for Python 3.7.12, but should also work for other 3.7.X versions. 

The package can be install with pip and git as follows:
